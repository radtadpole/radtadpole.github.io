I am a student at the University of Oregon focusing on spatial analysis, cartography, and data visualizations. I enjoy exploring the ways geography intersects with technology and design to better understand patterns, places, and people. Using tools like GIS and mapping software, I strive to turn complex data into clear, engaging visuals. Whether I’m working on a research project or a personal map, I’m always interested in how spatial thinking can help solve real-world problems and spark curiosity about the world around us.

On this site, you'll find:
- A little bit of information about me.

- Maps and graphics I've done for classes or in my free time experimenting with data and designs.

Experiences
======
1. I’ve worked on a range of GIS projects developing my experience with managing spatial data and making maps that inform zoning, transportation, and infrastructure planning. I worked extensively with ArcGIS Pro to review parcel databases and analyze demographic shifts. A key project involved creating a tangible map that showed park and transit access with neighborhoods of older populations to help determine their accessibility and mobility within the City of Eugene. This experience enhanced my technical abilities and the importance of reviewing attributes of data, so that moving forward data is applicable to the context of a problem.
1. From my experience working in the service sector, I’ve come to understand that excelling in one’s role requires more than just technical skills; it also involves fostering trust with others. Trust serves as a foundation for open communication, encouraging colleagues and others to share ideas and provide constructive feedback with confidence. During my time at Harkins Theaters, effectively listening to the goals, intentions, and plans of my team members allowed me to fulfill my responsibilities as a facilitator and shape my approach to leadership and workplace dynamics, reinforcing the importance of trust, communication, and positivity in order to achieve success.

1. Through the many years of being a student, I consider mentorship an invaluable part of personal and professional growth. As a result, I've found a deep appreciation for the guidance and wisdom that mentorship offers, leading to a greater commitment in seeking out supportive relationships that foster learning, growth, and a stronger sense of direction in both academic and professional pursuiits.
