Thanks for visiting my website!

I am a student at the University of Oregon focusing on spatial analysis, cartography, and data visualizations. I enjoy exploring the ways geography intersects with technology and design to better understand patterns, places, and people. Using tools like GIS and mapping software, I strive to turn complex data into clear, engaging visuals. Whether I’m working on a research project or a personal map, I’m always interested in how spatial thinking can help solve real-world problems and spark curiosity about the world around us.

On this site, you'll find:
- A little bit of information about me.

- Maps and graphics I've done for classes or in my free time experimenting with data and designs.
