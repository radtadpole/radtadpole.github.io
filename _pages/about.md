Thanks for visiting my website! 
I am a student at the University of Oregon focusing on spatial analysis, cartography, and data visualizations. My work blends technical expertise in GIS tools and mapping software with thoughtful design principles to produce maps that are not only accurate but also visually engaging. Whether exploring geographic patterns or telling a spatial story, I aim to create maps that are both informative and compelling, reflecting a strong foundation in both analytical and creative approaches to geography.
